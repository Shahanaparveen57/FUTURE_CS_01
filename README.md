# FUTURE_CS_01  
### Task 1 — Web Application Security Testing  
Cyber Security Internship @ Future Interns

---

## 📌 About this Task  
This is the first task of my Cyber Security internship with Future Interns.  
Here, I worked on a sample vulnerable web application (like OWASP Juice Shop or DVWA) to practice ethical hacking.  
The main goal was to identify common security flaws (SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.) and document them following OWASP Top 10 standards.

---

## 🛠 Tools I Used  
- Burp Suite (Community Edition) → manual testing & intercepting requests  
- OWASP ZAP → automated scanning for vulnerabilities  
- SQLMap → testing for SQL injection  
- Nikto → scanning for server-level issues  
- Kali Linux / VirtualBox → safe testing environment

---

## 📄 Deliverables  
- Security Report (PDF) → findings + remediation steps  
- Screenshots → proof of vulnerabilities tested  
- Logs → outputs from ZAP, SQLMap, and Nikto

---

## 🎯 Key Learnings  
- How to perform web app penetration testing  
- Better understanding of OWASP Top 10 threats  
- Writing professional-style security reports with risk ratings  
- Organizing work in a GitHub portfolio
